SpeakKeys ("the App") is an Android voice keyboard (IME). This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user data.

## 1) What data the App handles

### a) Microphone audio
When you use voice typing, the App records audio from your microphone to transcribe speech to text.

### b) Transcription content
Audio is converted to text and inserted into the app where you are typing.

### c) API keys you provide
If you use cloud transcription, you may enter your own API keys in **Settings > API** (for example, OpenAI and/or Sarvam).

### d) App settings
The App stores local preferences (such as selected provider and keyboard settings) on your device.

## 2) How data is used

The App uses the above data only to provide core app functionality, including:
- voice-to-text transcription,
- keyboard behavior and preferences,
- provider configuration based on your settings.

## 3) Cloud transcription providers

SpeakKeys can send audio to third-party transcription providers selected/configured by you, such as:
- OpenAI: https://openai.com/policies
- Sarvam AI: https://www.sarvam.ai/privacy-policy

When you use these providers, their terms and privacy policies apply to data processed by them.

## 4) Data sharing and sale

- We do **not** sell personal data.
- We do **not** share your data for advertising purposes.
- Data is transmitted only as needed to provide transcription through the provider you choose.

## 5) Data retention

- The App does not maintain a separate backend server for storing your voice recordings.
- API keys and settings are stored locally on your device until you change or clear them.
- Transcription providers may retain/process data according to their own policies.

## 6) Security

- Data sent to cloud providers is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).
- No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we take reasonable steps to protect data handled by the App.

## 7) Permissions used

SpeakKeys may request:
- **RECORD_AUDIO** – to capture voice input for speech-to-text.
- **INTERNET** – to send audio to selected cloud transcription provider(s).

## 8) Children's privacy

SpeakKeys is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us and we will take reasonable steps to address it.

## 9) Your choices

You can:
- stop using voice typing at any time,
- revoke microphone permission in Android settings,
- remove API keys in **Settings > API**,
- uninstall the App to remove locally stored app data.

## 10) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted at the same policy URL with a revised effective date.
